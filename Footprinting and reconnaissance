It is the process of identifying and understanding the security risks present in an organization. 
Like reconnaissance, it involves gathering as much information about the target as possible,including information that may not be readily available online.
This information can then be used to build a profile of the organizationâ€™s security posture and identify potential vulnerabilities.


There are two main types of footprinting: passive and active.
Passive footprinting: Gathering information from publicly available sources such as websites, news articles, and company profiles
Active footprinting: Using more intrusive methods to access sensitive data, such as hacking into systems or applying social engineering techniques

What Is Reconnaissance?

Footprinting is a part of a larger process known as reconnaissance.
Reconnaissance is the information-gathering stage of ethical hacking, where you collect data about the target system

Data collected from reconnaissance may include:
Security policies
Network infrastructure. 
Employee contact details
Host information
