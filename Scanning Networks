What is Scanning?

Scanning is a set of procedures for identifying live hosts, ports, and services, discovering Operating system and architecture of target system, Identifying vulnerabilities and threats in the network.
Network scanning is used to create a profile of the target organization
Scanning refers to collecting more information using complex and aggressive reconnaissance techniques.

#TYPES_OF_SCANNING
Network scanning
port scanning
vulnerability scanning

#Network_Scanning
Network scanning is a process used to identify active devices (hosts), services running on them, and other details about the system and network
#TOOLS
"Angry ip scanner"
"Nmap"
#USE
sudo fping is used to show active devices in a network
route -n
sudo fping -aqg <ip address/24>
fping is used to get active ip in a network

#Network_scanning_using_ARP
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol or procedure that connects an ever-changing Internet Protocol (IP) address to a fixed physical machine address, also known as a media access control (MAC) address, in a local-area network (LAN).

#note
Devices can block ICMP but they can not block ARP requests
sudo arping <IP ADDRESS>
sudo arp-scan <ipaddress/24>
#Network_scanning_using_netdiscover
sudo netdiscover -r <ip/24>
sudo netdiscover -P -i <interface name>
sudo nmap -Sn <ip>


#Port_scanning
A port scan is a common technique hackers use to discover open doors or weak points in a network.
A port scan attack helps cyber criminals find open ports and figure out whether they are receiving or sending data.

Port 20 (UDP): File Transfer Protocol (FTP) used for transferring data
Port 22 (TCP): Secure Shell (SSH) protocol used for FTP, port forwarding, and secure logins
Port 23 (TCP): The Telnet protocol used for unencrypted communication
Port 53 (UDP): The Domain Name System (DNS), which translates internet domain names into machine-readable IP addresses
Port 80 (TCP): The World Wide Web Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
